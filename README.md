# Filtering-Noise-in-Digital-Images

Have you ever captured a photo using your camera and thought that "I had captured a perfect photo but why does it look so messy", then what you might have encountered is noise in the captured image. 
In the current world of digital imaging, one of the most challenging problems is the presence of noise. Whether you're capturing a photo with your smartphone or processing satellite imagery, noise can degrade image quality, making it difficult to extract meaningful information and visually unappealing. Noise is often regarded as the random variations in brightness or color, corrupting the details that truly matter. Fortunately, we have many techniques in the image processing field to filter out this unwanted noise. One of the most common ways to remove noise is the use of filters. In this blog, we'll explore some of the most common methods for reducing additive noise, ensuring that our images are recovered without this unwanted noise.
